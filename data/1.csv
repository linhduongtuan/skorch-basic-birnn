About the sound:
Clear, they are amazingly clear. If you like to hear all the instruments you are going to enjoy them.

Bass, if you like it, they have it.
Comfort: very very comfortable. They are light and you might forget that you are wearing them.
Pads: made of plastic. I start sweating after an hour.

". The Sony app allows you to change your listening mode - Arena, Club, Outdoor Stage, and Concert Hall. For me, turning this off was the best option. That gave me better treble but still maintained enough of the bass that I could ""feel"" it. The app also has an equalizer so you can pretty much adjust the sound to your liking. It saves what you did so you don't have to fuss with it when you use the headphones the next time.

The fit of the Sony is about the same as the Bose. They look a lot alike which is to say they look pretty much like most other headsets out there. It's going to take awhile for me t",0,1
". I paired it to my phone and that was it. I downloaded the app but that's not necessary to use the headphones. After charging them up over night I used them a lot before I felt like I should charge them again but it turns out they still had about half of their charge left. With the Bose I always had a spare battery in the case for an insurance policy. If you run out of juice on the Sony you can just plug the audio cable in and continue listening (cable is included).

I think the Bose has a slight edge on noise canceling but it's razor edge. One area that I work in has a lot of prop airplane traffic. The Bose noise canceling blocks about 99% of the whine. I really had to listen to hear the noise with the Sony and even then it was faint. OK, I changed my mind - it's a draw.

The volume control when paired (by default at least) operates the volume on both speakers. This is a positive and negative. The negative is I can't balance the volume between two connected speakers. If paired with a higher wattage speaker for example, I can be standing almost right next to this one and not hear it. If there is someway to change the volume on one speaker, but not the other connected speaker, I haven't discovered it.

Some speakers with similar wattage, such as the Bose I own are more compact than this, something to consider if traveling with limited space. (The Bose is of course much more expensive however)

I haven't use this speaker away from a power supply enough to comment on battery life in any detail.

Overall, it's a great little, versatile speaker for the price, and it's nice to be able to connect it wirelessly to another speaker, but in my opinion the controls, shape, and connection to other JBL speakers could be improved upon.",0,1

It can be paired with other compatible JBL connect speakers.

When connected to another speaker, the volume control on either speaker will change the volume on both, allowing me to turn the total volume down from ether speaker or from my phone or tablet (this can also be a negative)

I can charge this via my car's cigarette lighter. (which I can't do with the similar Bose speaker I own)

Negatives/things to consider:

Some of the controls on the speaker are not backlit and are not directly on top,",0,1

Establishing a connection between this speaker and the JBL Boost TV speaker has been somewhat of a pain. When the connection is lost, I find I need reestablish connections in a certain order or it won't work.

 I would never travel on this airline ever again in life. Until now I can’t get my bag or any word about it! I asked where to go to claim for my bag and everyone behave as if I was speaking Chinese to a bunch of people who had no idea what I was saying. On top of that they were issuing blankets because the gate area was so cold and my son went for a blanket and the guy did not give my 6 year old a blanket on top of being canceled without notifications. Not even a bottle of water was offered. I would never ever travel on this airline ever again !,0,1
