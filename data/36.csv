" He was condescending from the beginning of the consultation and continued throughout. Did not make me comfortable in the slightest to ask any sort of medical question as I just wanted the consultation to be over with as soon as possible. I tried voicing my concern with a particular type of medication and he immediately got defensive saying he never once recommended I use that kind of medication and even had the audacity to tell me he’s been practicing medicine for longer than I’ve been alive. 80% of the information he gave me I already knew from basic web research, which he would have known if he had bothered to ask me any questions regarding my knowledge. This is the first negative experience I’ve ever had with a physician, to the point where I felt compelled to write a review.",1,0
