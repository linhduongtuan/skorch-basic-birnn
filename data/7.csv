That gave me better treble but still maintained enough of the bass that I could ""feel"" it. The app also has an equalizer so you can pretty much adjust the sound to your liking. It saves what you did so you don't have to fuss with it when you use the headphones the next time.

Establishing a connection between this speaker and the JBL Boost TV speaker has been somewhat of a pain. When the connection is lost, I find I need reestablish connections in a certain order or it won't work.

The volume control when paired (by default at least) operates the volume on both speakers. This is a positive and negative. The negative is I can't balance the volume between two connected speakers.

 I was then told I needed to speak to Head Oiffice and would be put through. After holding for 40 mins I rang again and the last guy offered me a refund of £516.27 which is not acceptable as why should I be out of pocket when its your Company’s error. I was then offered £542 which I have accepted but I am not happy with as why should you profit from my disappointment!! So now not only have I now got to find another flight but I also have to wait for up to ten days to get my refund. Appaling service and the flight I thought I had booked is still being offered on your website. I would like to add that Anikt did try to help resolve this issue as opposed to anyone else.,0,1

On Thursday, August 9, 2018 I was told by UPS that my packages would be picked up from BHM and redelivered Friday, August 10, 2018 (it will be the first delivery attempt because the driver bypassed delivering and went straight to this UPS Access Point).  I was at home waiting for both of these packages that never came.  Anyway, the lazyUPS driver delivered the second package in question today.  I asked about the first package that I filed the BBB Complaint and the UPS investigation and was informed that the first package is in transit to the sender.

After waiting couple weeks, I then sent an email regarding this to their CEO Greg Clark and now it's a week and no news from him, not even a courtesy reply saying they have received my email.

" Breakfast, lunch and dinner. The three meals were sufficient for all occasions, although they were not as significant in protein, they were very nutritious, varied and delicious. Our house had a vegeterian, his food came separate from ours.
          On the first day, orientation day, we went to a house that they explained us what we were going to do exactly in each kind of program. We had the opportunity to know all the volunteers and the staff that worked with us. About the childcare program. Every morning they picked us up by 7:30 and left us in the school of the Capricorn community. The place was very safe, and the school staff and kids were already used to the volunteers, they made us feel like home. The van used to pick us up half a day at school and leave us back at the house with our lunch.
